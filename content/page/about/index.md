## About me

Hello, my name is Axiom and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Cybersecurity at an institution recognized by the NSA (National Security Agency) as a National Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Cyber Operations alongside my profession as an IT Technician. I hold a dynamic blend of skills cultivated through developing open-source software, specifically in the realm of open-source intelligence, which I leverage to automate tasks relating to intelligence, analysis, and data extraction/archival.

## About the blog

This site will hold primarily technical information relating to privacy, security, open-source intelligence, and software development. I am also an avid home-labber and will upload information relating to homelabs and self-hosting. I will occasionally upload research and findings relating to gaming, gaming systems, and the modification of the systems in question. I will also use this site as a compilation of coursework completed per the requirements of my degree. Only recently did I begin publishing information relating to my projects in the hopes that someone, somewhere might find my works to be of use. 

## Projects

Most of the software I develop will have a dedicated post on this site detailing the process, research, and findings; however, in the case that it is not, one can find other software solutions I develop on my Github: [https://github.com/ax-i-om](https://github.com/ax-i-om). The projects I am most proud of are detailed below:

### Bitcrook

Bitcrook is an open-source intelligence apparatus that aims to centralize all of the tools necessary to conduct an online investigation by aggregating results from various sources. It leverages multiple frameworks to provide a sleek and intuitive interface. I started this project to learn the semantics of the Go language, but it has since evolved into something much more. It has since been recognized by [Flashpoint (Cyber Threat Intelligence)](https://flashpoint.io/), [OSINT Newsletter](https://osintnewsletter.com/), and various online forums relating to Cybersecurity and adjacent fields. 

### Tempest

Tempest is a simple, lightweight, and cross-platform solution designed to enable individuals to efficiently discover and extract active cloud storage/file sharing links from paste platforms such as [Rentry](https://rentry.co). It was created to address the notable uptick in paste sites being used to distribute content that violates copyright and piracy statutes. This software was designed with researchers in mind, and so it provides various data presentation formats enabling researchers to engage in advanced analytics

A theme present throughout my projects is a highly modular design philosophy that allows for the simple usage, development, maintenance, and integration of the software I develop.

## AI Disclosure

I believe that disclosure of the use of artificial intelligence is extremely important to help mitigate any potential damages. Throughout my online presence, I leverage artificial intelligence to generate images that accompany the contents of my projects. For example, my profile picture here and on Github were generated with artificial intelligence (specifically, OpenAI's DALL-E 2). I will disclose any other instances of **my** usage of artificial intelligence to generate such works in the scope of this site and my projects on Github to the best of my ability. These disclosures can be found in the contents of the corresponding posts/projects. 

## Contact
